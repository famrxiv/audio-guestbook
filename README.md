**Modifications by DD4WH, August 1st, 2022:**
* recordings are now saved as WAV files
* recordings on the SD card can be accessed via USB, no more need to take out the SD card
* code modifications for a telephone with closing contact as the handheld is being lifted
* playback only plays the very last recorded file, not ALL the files ever recorded
* does not play the greeting message again when you want to listen to your recordings
* some bugfixes and warnings eliminated
* do not forget that your greeting message has to be recorded as a wav with a sample rate of 44.1ksps, otherwise it is not played
* compile the code with CPU speed 150MHz, this can save a lot of battery power (reduction by about 70%)
